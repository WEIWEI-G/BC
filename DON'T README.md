This study is based on NGS targeted sequencing, and the analysis code has been organized and uploaded. Due to China’s regulations on human genetic resources and related data-security requirements, the raw sequencing data cannot be fully shared in a public repository. 

I hope that this work can meet the academic requirements for my Master’s graduation, although limitations cased by these compliance constraints; and I have done my best to analyze and interpret the data carefully. 
I truly hope this work meets the requirements for my Master’s graduation. I want this degree very much, not only to finish this stage, but to keep going and stay in research.
